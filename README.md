Original data and source code of the paper “Exploring the determinants of global vaccination campaign to combat COVID-19”.

Our experiments mainly consist of four parts, namely, the transformission of Twitter topics, the  analysis of vaccine-related topics based on SHAP, the fine-grained emotion analysis of Twitter users, and the correlation analysis of user emotion and vaccination.

Since the original Twitter data is too large to upload, interested scholars can contact this email：mikijjj@163.com
